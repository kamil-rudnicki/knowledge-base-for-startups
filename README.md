## Team Members

* [Smart Guy Productivity Pitfalls](http://bookofhook.blogspot.com/2013/03/smart-guy-productivity-pitfalls.html)
* QA - looks at features and code, and propmt programmers for things, that he was too lazy to think about - he decides if feature is ready to be realeased. Also makes sure nothing is broken. Fundamentall difference between dev vs qa is that qa brakes things. Crashes are their fault.
* Helpdesk
* Product managers - communicate, thinks about features, talks with coders - only convincing them (peers), talks with customers, make specifications. He is thinking about magic functions, coders thinks about practical making - they must met in the middle.
* Don’t micromanage, don’t pretend to give decisions to employees
* Use your own products
* Don’t make a meetings about problem solving - only when you must communicate something
* Cutting down communication to minimum
* Fix things twice - the problem, and never happen it again

## Environment & Culture

* As much as possible of natural light
* Two monitors, headphones
* Free lunch
* http://predictablerevenue.com/nearsoft/

## Schedules

## Design of software

* Constant learning what they use and don't
* Let users vote for features (like surveys)
* Ask why they did not go with us (they resign)
* Constant usability tests (in house, or other way)
* Create API and customization
* If you will have critical mass, create a marketplace
* [Missing Features Are Better Than Partial Features](http://bookofhook.blogspot.com/2013/02/missing-features-are-better-than.html)
* Make people happy - Inability of control things - makes people not try, and lack of effort, which leads to unhappiness, so people are helplessness, people must feel that they can easily get what they want, software shouldn’t interrupt this process. Put the user in control. Give them feedback. Don’t hide things beyond their reach!
* Obsess over aestetics - you can decorate in some way
* Constant interation
* getflow.com, mint, wufoo, stripe, trello, Intercom.io
