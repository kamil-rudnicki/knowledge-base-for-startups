* QA - looks at features and code, and propmt programmers for things, that he was too lazy to think about - he decides if feature is ready to be realeased. Also makes sure nothing is broken. Fundamentall difference between dev vs qa is that qa brakes things. Crashes are their fault.
* Helpdesk
* Product managers - communicate, thinks about features, talks with coders - only convincing them (peers), talks with customers, make specifications. He is thinking about magic functions, coders thinks about practical making - they must met in the middle.
* Don’t micromanage, don’t pretend to give decisions to employees
* Use your own products
* Don’t make a meetings about problem solving - only when you must communicate something
* Cutting down communication to minimum
* Fix things twice - the problem, and never happen it again
