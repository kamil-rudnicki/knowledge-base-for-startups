* Business based on optimization of something, is a bad idea (or at least 10x better)
* Idea you must be passionate about. Will change the world fo a better by only this idea. Build business because they have to. They have so much passion, so much belief in what they are doing that they almost don’t have a choice but to build it. Insted of “ want to be an enterpreneur and let me find and analyze various market opportunities.”
* 10 business ideas in 2 months. Fail fast and cheap. Sell for real, don’t talk. You will feel it, when it have traction. (Chegg). You just put the product on the market. People are killing themselves for you.
* It will be one of the features that works very well. Go that way. Chegg - marketplace for students -> books was 80% of their transactions
* Be sensitive what doesn't work and pain points in this world or near you
* It is too late, if there are too many familiar names in the market
* Validate by talking with customers, quick answer, yes, I would use vs. no, I wouldn’t. Do you have this problem? Where is it on your pain-point spectrum?
* Market size matters

* Two types: big markets - with VC, niche markets - without VC
